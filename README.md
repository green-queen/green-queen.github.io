## Using the Skin
You can use this skin, and the full repository, by either a) cloning the repository on your local device or b) forking the repository and making a pull request (which will contribute to the original repository):
a) click the green CODE button and follow instructions, mainly:
`git clone http://green-queen.github.io/cb-skin2`
b) try to edit the code. it will prompt you to make a fork.

If you want to update the data, go to `/_data` and add your new sheet or edit the existing ones. Then, edit the line for metadata in the `_config.yml` file to be the title of the new metadata file you want to use.

## NOTE
Note for Emily and Iris that I am not currently launching the site through GitHub Pages, since it will hotlink all of the images from the original image sources in NZ until we download each image (BAD).
